Yes, that's exactly the right process. Vercel is designed to work seamlessly with GitHub.

Here is the complete setup for your GitHub repository. Vercel requires a specific file structure and a configuration file (vercel.json) to understand how to deploy a Python server.

---

### **✅ Step 1: Your GitHub Repository Structure**

Create a new, empty repository on GitHub. Inside that repository, you will create three files with the following structure:

/  
├── api/  
│   └── index.py        \# Your main Python server code  
├── vercel.json         \# Vercel's configuration file  
└── requirements.txt    \# The list of Python libraries needed

---

### **🐍 Step 2: The Code for Each File**

Create the files and copy/paste the code below into each one.

#### **api/index.py**

This is your main FastAPI application. Vercel will automatically find and run this file.

Python

from fastapi import FastAPI  
import pystac\_client  
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

\# The main application instance that Vercel will run  
app \= FastAPI()

\# Pydantic models for type checking the incoming request  
class STACRequest(BaseModel):  
    stac\_url: str \= Field(..., example="https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/rest-interface-stac-api")  
    query: dict | None \= None  
    bbox: list\[float\] | None \= None  
    datetime\_str: str | None \= None  
    collections: list\[str\] | None \= None  
    limit: int \= 10

\# Your main tool endpoint, now at the root of the server  
@app.post("/tools/search\_stac\_items")  
def search\_stac\_items(request: STACRequest) \-\> dict:  
    """  
    Searches a STAC API endpoint based on provided parameters.  
    This is the function your LLM will call.  
    """  
    try:  
        client \= pystac\_client.Client.open(request.stac\_url)  
          
        search \= client.search(  
            collections=request.collections,  
            bbox=request.bbox,  
            datetime=request.datetime\_str,  
            query=request.query,  
            limit=request.limit,  
        )  
          
        \# Get results as a standard dictionary  
        items\_dict \= search.get\_all\_items\_as\_dict()  
        return items\_dict

    except Exception as e:  
        \# Return a structured error message  
        return {"error": f"Failed to query STAC API. Reason: {str(e)}"}

\# A root endpoint for health checks to easily see if the server is running  
@app.get("/")  
def read\_root():  
    return {"status": "STAC MCP Server is running"}

#### **requirements.txt**

This file tells Vercel which Python libraries to install.

Plaintext

fastapi  
uvicorn  
pystac-client  
pydantic

#### **vercel.json**

This file tells Vercel how to build and route requests to your Python app.

JSON

{  
  "builds": \[  
    {  
      "src": "/api/index.py",  
      "use": "@vercel/python"  
    }  
  \],  
  "routes": \[  
    {  
      "src": "/(.\*)",  
      "dest": "/api/index.py"  
    }  
  \]  
}

### **🚀 Step 3: Deploy**

1. **Push to GitHub:** Commit these three files and push them to your new GitHub repository.  
2. **Link Vercel:** In your Vercel dashboard, create a "New Project" and import your GitHub repository.  
3. **Deploy:** Vercel will automatically detect the vercel.json file, install the requirements, and deploy your server.

Once it's finished, Vercel will give you a public URL (like https://your-project-name.vercel.app). **That is the URL you will paste into your LLM's "Server URL" field.**
